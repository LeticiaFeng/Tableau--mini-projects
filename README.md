## 💊 Why Pharmaceutical Industry?

I'm learning SAS with a focus on its application in the **pharmaceutical and healthcare industries**, where it is widely used for clinical trial analysis, FDA submissions, and regulatory reporting.

To guide my learning, I’m using the book _“SAS Programming in the Pharmaceutical Industry”_ and practicing through:
- Reproducing book exercises
- Writing annotated code for typical clinical trial data problems
- Creating mock datasets and reports for domain-specific scenarios

I Hope This not only strengthen my **technical skills** in SAS, but also deepen my understanding of **industry standards**, **regulatory requirements**, and **clinical data workflows**.
